# React Sandbox

Welcome to my **React Sandbox** repository! This is a personal playground where I experiment with different React concepts, libraries, and tools. It's a space to practice, learn, and break things in a safe environment.

## Purpose

This repository is intended for:

- **Learning**: Experimenting with React features (hooks, context, routing, etc.).
- **Testing**: Trying out different React libraries, testing strategies, and best practices.
- **Prototyping**: Quickly building small React apps or components to understand new concepts.
- **Sandboxing**: A place to play around without the pressure of building a full project.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

In this sandbox, I explore various React topics and tools, such as:

- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks, etc.)
- Component design patterns (functional components, higher-order components, etc.)
- React Router for routing
- State management (Context API, Redux, Recoil, etc.)
- Testing with **Jest** and **React Testing Library**
- Styling with **CSS Modules**, **Styled Components**, or any other method
- Integration with external APIs, third-party libraries, and frameworks
- Exploring new features in React (Suspense, Server Components, etc.)
